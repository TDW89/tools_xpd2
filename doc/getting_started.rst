Getting Started
===============

Before installing xpkg you need to have python installed on your system.

The xpkg github repository can be found here:

  http://github.com/xcore/tool_xpkg

To install, first clone the repository::

  git clone http://github.com/xcore/tool_xpkg

and then run the ``setup.py`` script::

  cd tool_xpkg
  python setup.py install

This should put the script ``xpkg`` into your executable path. You
will probably need superuser/administrator priveledges to do this.
