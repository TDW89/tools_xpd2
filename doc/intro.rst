Introduction
============



``xpkg`` is a python script that performs package management for XMOS
and XCore source code repositories. The tool:

   * Tracks dependencies of the repository
   * Manages releases (and their dependency)

Using this tool is highly recommended for release management of your
repository since it is maintained by XMOS and is designed to be compatible with
future features in the both the XMOS development tools and the XCore
open source repositories.
